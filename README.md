## Assumptions:

1.At the opening of the project , It will show static data.

2.On the click of show button it will show the data is in console. Mapping is not working correctly so I put in console only.

## Installation:

Step 1: Download the repository.

Step 2: Open the project folder in your IDE and terminal. Type the command npm install if you have already installed node then no need             to install again only put the below two commands.

Step 3: After completing installation of node modules, Type next command npm server.js for server side and npm start for client side.             The application will run in the development mode.

## Problem Facing:

I have completed this with addition of new book with information into the database from frontend. But I am able showed the data which is present in database in console only. I was trying to map the console data but it will go wrong syntacticaly. Also I have created a api for updatation of profile.

## Objective:

To create a book store application.
